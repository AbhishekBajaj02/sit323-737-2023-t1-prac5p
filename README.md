Explanation of the code-:
Dockerizing a Node.js web app involves creating a Docker image that contains everything necessary to run the application, including the code, dependencies, and configuration. Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your application into a portable, isolated container that can be run on any system that has Docker installed.
To create a Docker image for your Node.js web app, you need to write a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. In this file, you specify the base image you want to use, such as the official Node.js runtime image, and the dependencies required by your application. You also copy your application code into the image and configure it to start when the container is launched.
Once you have written your Dockerfile, you can build the Docker image by running the "docker build" command. This command creates a new Docker image based on the instructions in your Dockerfile. You can specify a name and a tag for the image using the "-t" flag.
After building the image, you can run a container from it using the "docker run" command. This command starts a new container from the image and runs your Node.js web app inside it. You can specify port mapping to map the container's port to the host port, so you can access the application in your browser.
Dockerizing a Node.js web app has many benefits, including portability, reproducibility, and scalability. Docker makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in a consistent and isolated environment, which can reduce the risk of conflicts and errors. It also allows you to scale your application up or down by running multiple instances of the container on different hosts or a single host with orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
